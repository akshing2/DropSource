# DropSource
This is a repository for a DOD droplet formation analysis app. This is part of an undergraduate research project in collaboration with the University of New South Wales and Inventia Life Science. 

## Aim of The Project
The purpose of this thesis project is to deliver an easy to use GUI application for researchers to analyse Drop-On-Demand Droplet formation from piezoelectric printerheads. Users input a series of images collected from a high speed camera.
The following parameters will be analysed:

1. Droplet Position.
2. Droplet Velocity.
3. Number of Satellites.
4. Length of Main Droplet Ligament.
5. Volume of Main Droplet.

## External Libraries Used
This project incorporates OpenCV libraries to conduct image processing and subsequent droplet analysis.

## Current Functionality
At this stage, the app is able to do the following:

1. Run the GUI, with input error checking.
2. Itterate through selected input directory.


## TODO
1. Implement Preprocessing.
2. Determine Droplet Position and Velocity.
3. Count Number of Satellites.
4. Calculate Length of Main Droplet Ligament.
5. Calculate Volume of Main Droplet.
